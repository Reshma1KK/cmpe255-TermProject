# Abstract

Pizza [@pizza2000identification] is an understudied yet widely utilized implement for delivering in-vivo *Solanum lycopersicum* based liquid mediums in a variety of next-generation mastications studies. Here we describe a de novo approach for large scale *T. aestivum* assemblies based on protein folding that drastically reduces the generation time of the mutation rate.

# Introduction

# Methods

## Data Preprocessing

Data Preprocessing is referred to as manipulation or dropping of data before it is used to ensure or enhance performance. It is basically the process of transforming the raw data into understandable format. Data preprocessing is the most important phase of  machine learning. It includes removing irrelevant and redundant information from the data. Examples of data preprocessing include cleaning, instance selection, normalization, feature extraction and selection. The product of data preprocessing is the final training set. The dataset that we have selected contained irrelevant and meaningless information which has been removed.

Firstly, we filtered the data by dropping duplicate rows. These values were removed to reduce the dimensionality. 

Next, we analysed that the dataset contained '-1' values throughout where almost all the rows had this value, so we cannot drop all this data. We then checked the percentage of '-1' values in each column.
